Touch Typing and Muscle Memory
You will not learn how to do touch typing if you wouldn't train by practicing repeatedly and correctly. Your muscles have a memory and you force them to keep that memory by repating. When you keep doing the task again and again the long term muscle memory is made. Eventually you will start doing it with your subconcious mind. You will need to press the key with your right finger though, because that's what your muscle will remeber. If you are not concentrating, it will not work out. There is no shame in looking at the keyboard and making sure that you are pressing the right key, when you are in the learning stage. Because you don't want to confuse your muscles.
